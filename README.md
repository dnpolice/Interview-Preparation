# Interview-Preparation
This file contains a few of the more difficult of the algorithms that I have written. These files contain both the questions along with the solutions. I wrote my thought process down before solving the more diffucult questions were I couldn't jump straight to coding. This can be seen in Disk Stacking, Numbers in Pi, Merge Linked Lists, and Max Sum Increasing Subsequence.
